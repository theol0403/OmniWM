The workspace bar is a centered floating island on each display. It shows a chip per workspace — with the workspace's name, emoji-friendly — and the icons of the apps open there.

**Unreleased (source builds):** The focused-workspace outline slides and resizes between chips with a responsive spring. Workspace and app changes, hover feedback, and bar resizing animate as well. Disable Animations in OmniWM or enable macOS Reduce Motion for immediate updates. In split mode, the focused-workspace outline animates within its island.

## Clicking the bar

- Click a workspace chip to switch to that workspace.
- Click an app icon to focus that window directly.
- When **Deduplicate App Icons** is enabled, multiple windows from one app share a single grouped icon with a count badge; click a grouped icon to open their window list, while a single-window icon focuses that window directly.
- macOS-hidden windows are marked with an eye-slash badge; selecting a hidden window unhides its app and focuses that exact window.
- Non-empty [scratchpad](/features/scratchpads/) slots appear as pills; clicking a pill toggles that scratchpad.

## System Stats

Optionally show a System Stats button that opens a CPU, memory, GPU, disk, and uptime popup. The `Toggle System Stats` hotkey and `omniwmctl command toggle-system-stats` drive the same popup, and both do nothing unless a monitor currently shows that workspace-bar button. See the [CLI reference](/reference/cli/overview/).

## Layout and appearance options

Configure position, height, and appearance in Settings:

- **Notch handling** — `Off`, `Move Below Menu Bar`, or a split layout (`Split — Active Left` / `Split — Active Right`) that flows the bar around the notch with your chosen side for the active workspace.
- **Reveal on modifier hold** — keep the bar hidden until you hold a chosen modifier.
- **Hide empty workspaces** — omit chips for workspaces with no windows.
- **Reserve layout space** — reserve room for the bar so tiled windows never sit underneath it.
- **Hide in Native Fullscreen** — hide the bar on a monitor while that monitor shows a macOS native fullscreen window, and bring it back on exit; reserved tiled layout space is left untouched so windows do not shuffle around the fullscreen session.
- **Custom accent and text colors**.
- **Per-monitor overrides** — change an individual display's bar independently.

### Additional appearance controls

- **Fill Left of Notch** — an additional notch mode that fills the menu-bar area left of the notch, covering application menus. Without a notch it uses the left half of the menu bar. This mode always hides in native fullscreen, regardless of **Hide in Native Fullscreen**.
- **Inactive Icon Opacity** — adjust unfocused app icons from 0–100%; **Reset to System Default** clears the override.
- **Transparent Background** — hide the bar material, tint, and border while keeping its contents interactive.
- **Solid Black Background** — use an opaque black bar; **Transparent Background** takes precedence when both are enabled.
- **Show Item Backgrounds** — show or hide backgrounds behind workspace groups, floating windows, scratchpads, and stats.
- **Show Accent Highlights** — show or hide the focused-workspace outline and focused-icon glow.

These options also support per-monitor overrides. See the [Settings Reference](/config/settings-reference/#workspacebar) for keys and defaults.

## Excluding apps and overriding icons

Exclude individual apps or choose alternate app icons across all monitors in Settings. Icon overrides can also be configured in `settings.toml` (see [Configuration](/config/configuration/)). Quote bundle IDs so TOML treats each dotted identifier as one key:

```toml
[workspaceBar.iconOverrides]
"com.example.App" = "icons/custom.icns"
"com.cmuxterm.app" = "bundle-resource:AppIconDark"
```

`bundle-resource:` loads a named image packaged inside the selected app. The Settings picker discovers likely app-icon resources on demand; runtime-generated or downloaded Dock icons may not be available. Absolute paths are used as written, `~` expands to your home directory, and relative paths are resolved from the directory containing `settings.toml`.

:::note
Overrides affect only the workspace bar. A valid override takes precedence over the app's standard icon; an unavailable or invalid image falls back to the standard icon, then the dashed placeholder when no app icon is available. OmniWM does not watch image files; use Replace to reload a file changed in place.
